# stock_market_prediction_using_simple_exponenetial_smoothing
In this .ipynb file we have tried to make a prediction on a stock market using the concept on Simple Exponential Smoothing where it will follow the level value and make a prediction on  proper foretasted value. which will make it more smoothing and also here we have tried to implement raw mathematical terms to get better outcome
